# Simon-Says-game
Simon Says is a classic memory and pattern recognition game. In the game, a series of colors, is presented to the player in a sequence. The player must then replicate the sequence exactly as it was presented. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds a more element to the pattern, making it longer and more challenging. The game continues until the player makes a mistake by not reproducing the correct sequence, at which point the game typically ends.
# How to play?
Follow the Sequence: Pay attention to the sequence of colors or actions displayed by the game.
Repeat the Sequence: After the game shows a sequence, repeat it by clicking or interacting with the corresponding colors or elements in the same order.
Advance Levels: As you successfully replicate each sequence, the game will progressively become more challenging by adding more elements to the sequence.
Game Over on Mistake: If you make a mistake by clicking the wrong element in the sequence, the game will end. You can then restart and try to beat your previous score.
